# Style-Transfer

This project implement with Tensorflow the Gatys Style Transfer algorithm.
This code can also be used for Texture generation.
It is the projet for my master degree internship.

This code is inspired from :

## Requirement 

Tensorflow >= 1.2

VGG19 CNN weight (It can be downloaded here : http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat)
